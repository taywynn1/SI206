Now for a cheer, they are here triumphant!
Here they come with banners flying,
In stalwart step they're nighing,
With shouts of vict'ry crying,
We hurrah, hurrah! We greet you now,
Hail!

Far we their praises sing
For the glory and fame they've brought us,
Loud let the bells then ring,
For here they come with banners flying
Far we their praises sing,
For the glory and fame they;ve brought us; 
Loud let the bells then ring, 
For here they come with banners flying,
Hurrah!

Hail to the victors valiant!
Hail to the conqu'ring heroes!
Hail! Hail! to Michigan,
the leaders and best
Hail to the victors valiant!
Hail to the conq'ring heroes!
Hail! Hail to Michigan,
The champions of the West!

We cheer then again,
We cheer and cheer again
For Michigan, We cheer for Michigan
We cheer with might and main
We cheer, cheer, cheer,
With might and main we cheer!

Hail to the victors valiant!
Hail to the conq'ring heroes!
Hail! Hail! to Michigan,
the leaders and best.
Champions of the West!
